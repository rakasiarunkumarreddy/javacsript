<!-- Explanation
function generateRandomNumber() {:

Imagine you're building a little machine (a function) that can do something special when you ask it to. This machine is called generateRandomNumber.
Everything inside the { } curly brackets is the set of instructions that this machine will follow whenever you tell it to start.
const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;:

Let's break this down:
Math.random(): Imagine you have a dice, but instead of numbers from 1 to 6, it gives you a number between 0 and 1, like 0.123 or 0.987. This is what Math.random() does—it rolls a dice and gives you a random number between 0 and 1.
Math.random() * 100: Now, if you want the number to be between 0 and 100 instead of between 0 and 1, you multiply it by 100. So, if you got 0.5 from Math.random(), now it becomes 50.
Math.floor(): When you multiply by 100, you might get a number like 23.56. But we don't want the decimal part, so we use Math.floor() to round it down to the nearest whole number, like 23.
+ 1: Finally, we add 1 to make sure the number is between 1 and 100, instead of between 0 and 99.
The final result is a whole number between 1 and 100, and we store this number in a box (or variable) called randomNumber.
const randomColor = \#${Math.floor(Math.random() * 16777215).toString(16)}`;`:

This line is like magic that creates a random color:
Math.random() * 16777215: Just like before, we get a random number. But this time, we multiply by a very big number (16,777,215) because that’s the biggest number we can use to make a color code.
Math.floor(): Again, we get rid of any decimal part to make it a whole number.
.toString(16): Computers think in a special way called hexadecimal, which is like using a different alphabet to write numbers. This turns our big number into a color code.
#${...}: We put a # at the front to make it look like a color code (like #FF5733), which is what computers use to decide what color to show.
We store this color code in a box (variable) called randomColor.
document.getElementById('random-number').textContent = \Random Number: ${randomNumber}`;`:

Think of the document as the blueprint of your webpage. When you want to change something on the page, you look at this blueprint.
getElementById('random-number'): Imagine your webpage is a big room, and you’ve labeled one part of it with a name tag that says "random-number." This line is like pointing to that part of the room.
**.textContent = \Random Number: ${randomNumber}`**: You are telling that part of the room to display a message. The message will be something like "Random Number: 42" (where 42` is the random number you just created).
document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;:

Now, we’re saying, "Hey, let's paint the walls of our room with this random color."
document.body: This is like pointing to the whole room (the webpage).
style.backgroundColor: This is like saying, "Let’s change the wall color."
= randomColor: Finally, we use the color we created earlier to paint the walls.
console.log("Generated Random Number:", randomNumber);:

Imagine you have a notebook where you write down important things to remember or share with others. The console.log is like writing something in that notebook.
Here, we're writing down "Generated Random Number:" followed by the actual number, so you can see it later in your notebook (which in this case is the console in your browser).
console.log("Generated Background Color:", randomColor);:

Just like the previous line, this one writes down the color code in the notebook so you can check what color was chosen every time you click the button.
So, when you click the button, this little machine (the function) does all these steps: it rolls a dice for a number, mixes paint for a color, updates the display on the page, paints the walls, and then writes everything down in its notebook (the console). -->
